Synopsis: Generate a SNP distance matric for each SC identified in the 464 subset
Step 1) R script (Write_IDS_for_SCs_to_csv_5Sep19.R)
  parse through BAPS output
  write lane IDs for SC to list
Step 2  Bash Script (make_core_alignment_for_SCs.sh)
  Use list in pcs5 with pf to place all annotations in a folder
  Run roary on each folder and generate SC-specific core gene alignment
Step 3
  Get SNP distances from each alignment
  Melt matrix into column
  Add metadata in
  Re-do Croucher plot
