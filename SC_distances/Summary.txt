Synopsis: Generate a SNP distance matric for each SC identified in the 464 subset

Step 1) R script (Write_IDS_for_SCs_to_csv_5Sep19.R)
  parse through BAPS output
  write lane IDs for SC to list

Step 2  Bash Script (make_core_alignment_for_SCs.sh)
  Use list in pcs5 with pf to place all annotations in a folder
  Run roary on each folder and generate SC-specific core gene alignment

Step 3 (core_gene_snps_and_dists.sh)
  Get SNP distances from each alignment (

Step 4
Bash Wrapper: for i in *dist.csv; do IFS='.d' read -r -a f <<< "$i"; out=${f[0]}.csv; Rscript melt_matrix.R $i $out .; done
melt_matrix.R uploaded to Github
  Melt matrix into column
Merge all distances into one csv file:
cat *csv | grep -v value > All_withinSC_distances.csv
  
Step 5
  Add metadata in
  Re-do Croucher plot
